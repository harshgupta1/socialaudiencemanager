Quartz Requires the Following Tables for All JDBC-persistent JobStores
QRTZ_CALENDARS
	Stores Quartz calendar information as blobs
QRTZ_CRON_TRIGGERS
	Stores cron triggers, including cron expression and time zone information
QRTZ_FIRED_TRIGGERS
	Stores status information relating to triggers that have fired and the relevant execution information about the related job.
QRTZ_PAUSED_TRIGGER_GRPS
	Stores the trigger groups that have been paused
QRTZ_SCHEDULER_STATE
	Stores a few pieces of information about the state of the Scheduler and other Scheduler instances (if used within a cluster)
QRTZ_LOCKS
	Stores pessimistic lock information for the application (if pessimistic locking is used)
QRTZ_JOB_DETAILS
	Stores detailed information for every configured Job
QRTZ_JOB_LISTENERS
	Stores information about configured JobListeners
QRTZ_SIMPLE_TRIGGERS
	Stores simple triggers, including repeat count, internal, and number of times triggered
QRTZ_BLOB_TRIGGERS
	Triggers stores as blobs (this is used when Quartz users create their own custom trigger types—with JDBC, JobStore does not have specific knowledge about how to store instances)
QRTZ_TRIGGER_LISTENERS
	Stores information about configured TriggerListeners
QRTZ_TRIGGERS
	Stores information about configured triggers
