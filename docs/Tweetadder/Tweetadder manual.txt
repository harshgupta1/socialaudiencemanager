Released 8/15/2010

Understanding the Toolbar Options/Windows:

——————————————–

Overview Screen

———————–

The overview screen allows you to monitor the status and activities of all of your account from one convenient table.

You can turn each account on or off by clicking on the account, and selecting the on/off button.  This is especially useful if you wish to pause updates to an account, or if you are managing an account from a different computer.

The user icons on the far left show which accounts are logged in, and which ones are logged off or turned off.

The on/off images show you which automation features are turned on or off for each account.  These settings can be turned on/off on the respective pages when you open the user’s settings.

To open a user to manage, you can either double click on the row, or select a row and click the “Open User” button.

If upgrading from a previous version, the software pulls down all profiles that were set up previously under your registration license.  If you wish to remove any profiles from this import, you can select the profile and hit the “Turn Account Off” button.  This only turns this profile off for this particular computer.

Open User Screen

————————-

Once you have highlighted a particular Twitter User from the Overview screen, you will then hit the Open User button.

On this screen you will complete all the settings your wish TweetAdder to perform on that particular  profile.

Settings

———-

Account Settings

———–

Custom User Agent – This changes what web browser and operating system Tweet Adder is emulating. (The default value should be fine for most users)

Only run automated tasks between… – This feature lets you keep Tweet Adder running all of the time, and set it to only run automated tasks during certain hours.

Update Following/Followers list – this is the interval range in which your following and followers lists are retrieved from twitter.  You can also do this manually on the “Following” or “Followers” pages. (The default value should be fine for most users)

Proxies are recommended only for advanced users.  An internet proxy may be needed with certain types of internet connections.  Proxies can also be used to add anonymity and make it appear that you are accessing Twitter from a different location.  Using proxies almost always will make Tweet Adder run slower, and be less reliable.  (Most users should not use proxies)

Black/White List

————-

Black List

Add users to the black list to prevent Tweet Adder from ever Following that person.

White List

Add users to the white list to prevent Tweet Adder from ever UnFollowing that person

Followers

—————-

This screen displays a list of all of the Twitter users who are following you.

Users who you followed using Tweet Adder will have the username available, as well as the numeric id.

The Follow Date is the date that Tweet Adder first saw the user was following you.  Therefore, the first time you run Tweet Adder, it will appear that all of your followers followed you that day.  Also, If you haven’t run Tweet Adder for several days, all of the new followers will appear to have followed you on the day you run the software.

Source – The source (when available) shows you how the person became your follower.  This allows you to see which searches on Tweet Adder are leading to people following you back.  This feature works best after you have been using the software for awhile.

Following

The Follow Date is the date that you followed the user.  However, if the user was not followed using Tweet Adder, the date will reflect the first time Tweet Adder saw that you were following the user. Therefore, the first time you run Tweet Adder, it will appear that you followed everyone on that day.

Source – The source (when the user was followed through Tweet Adder) shows you why the user was followed.  For example, you can see what search terms you used to find them, or if they followed you first and you followed them back.

Open User > Block 3 (Follow and Unfollow Settings)

——————————————————

Follow:

———–

This feature will send follows to users whose IDs you have collected on the “To Follow List”.  Following users, along with providing useful Twitter posts, is a great way to increase the number of users who are following you.

You can “Send Follows Now” and you can turn On/Off Automated Follows from this screen.  Resist the urge to be a kid on Christmas morning and blasting out as many follows as fast as possible.  Slow and steady wins the race.

While the instant gratification of sending follows now is nice, we highly recommend that you use the automation settings.  It is a much more natural way of following users, and over time is generally much easier and successful.

# to send – This is the number of follows that will be sent now if you press the ‘Start’ button

Maximum Follows to send per day – This will limit the number of follows you send per day (reset at midnight)

Time Delay Between Follows – This is the delay in seconds between follows that are sent.

Stop adding follows ratio – This feature is good to use to keep your ratios in check.  It is not good to have a lot more followers than people following you.

Follow Back

————

This feature will send follows to users who are currently following you.  Following users is a good way to show them you appreciate them following you, and help build a relationship.  On a side note, following back a lot of users can reduce your free following space for twitter to allow you to follow new people due to their ratio limitations.

You can “Follow Back Now” and you can turn On/Off Automated Follow Back from this screen.

While the instant gratification of following users back now is nice, we highly recommend that you use the automation settings.  It is a much more natural way of following users, and over time is generally much easier and successful.

# to send – This is the number of follows that will be sent now if you press the ‘Start’ button

Maximum Follows to send per day – This will limit the number of follows you send per day (reset at midnight)

Time Delay Between Follows – This is the delay in seconds between follows that are sent.

Stop adding follows ratio – This feature is good to use to keep your ratios in check.  It is not good to have a lot more followers than people following you

UnFollow Users

——————-

This feature will stop following users which you have previously followed.

IMPORTANT

Make sure you have “Who to Unfollow” set correctly. The options are:

*UnFollow nonreciprocal follows that were followed using Tweet Adder

*UnFollow any nonreciprocal follows

*UnFollow All follows (except whitelist – found in Block 1 of Settings)

We recommend the first option, “UnFollow nonreciprocal follows that were followed using Tweet Adder”

We also recommend that you check “Wait x days for a user to follow you back before UnFollowing Them”

2-3 is a good number of days to wait.

You can “Send UnFollows Now” and you can turn On/Off Automated UnFollow from this screen.

While the instant gratification of unfollowing users  now is nice, we highly recommend that you use the automation settings.  It is a much more natural way of unfollowing users, and over time is generally much easier and successful.

# to UnFollow – This is the number of unfollows that will be sent now if you press the ‘Start’ button

Maximum UnFollows to send per day – This will limit the number of unfollows you send per day (reset at midnight)

Time Delay Between UnFollows – This is the delay in seconds between unfollows that are sent.

Stop UnFollowing ratio – This feature is good to use to keep your ratios in check.  It is not good to have a lot more followers than people following you

Unique Tweet Generator

———————————–

This feature is good if you want to post multiple tweets that say roughly the same thing.

This works by replacing a few words in your Tweet with multiple alternate words within brackets [ ] that are separate with commas.

Example: The [quick,slow,fast] [brown,green,blue,red]

fox [jumped,walked,hopped] [over,past,under] the

[lazy,tired,boring] dog.

This is an extreme example that would yield many many unique tweets.

Generated Tweets are saved to your “Tweets” list.

You must turn “Automation On” for this feature to work.

RSS URL – URL of the RSS resource

There is an option to include the title or the description.  We recommend one or the other as there is usually not room for both – extra text is truncated.

Links in the RSS feed are automatically shortened using Tiny.ly for your convenience.

Tweet Prefix – This allows you to put text before the text in the RSS.  An example would be “Breaking News >>”

Tweet Suffix – This allows you to put text at the end of a tweet.  This mainly used for hash tags.
